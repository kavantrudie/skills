# Update Context Skill

A global Claude Code skill for maintaining persistent context documentation across all your projects.

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone into your global Claude skills directory
git clone https://github.com/kavantrudie/claude-update-context-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/update-context
```

### Alternative: Project-Specific Installation

```bash
# Clone into your project's .claude/skills directory
git clone https://github.com/kavantrudie/claude-update-context-skill.git ./.claude/skills/update-context
```

After installation, restart Claude Code CLI to load the skill.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Manual Invocation

```bash
# Document a feature you're working on
/update-context feature my-feature-name

# Document a bug analysis
/update-context bug issue-123

# Document an architectural decision
/update-context architecture auth-redesign
```

### Option 2: Automatic Invocation

Just mention it in conversation:
```
"Let's document this feature implementation"
"Can you capture this architectural decision?"
"Document this bug fix for future reference"
```

Claude will automatically invoke the skill and create organized documentation.

## What It Does

This skill captures your conversation context and creates structured markdown documentation in your project's `.claude/context-docs/` directory:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── context-docs/
        ├── features/
        │   └── my-feature.md
        ├── bugs/
        │   └── issue-123.md
        ├── architecture/
        │   └── auth-redesign.md
        ├── refactors/
        ├── performance/
        └── security/
```

## Documentation Types

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feature` | New features and implementations | `/update-context feature shopping-cart` |
| `bug` | Bug analysis and fixes | `/update-context bug checkout-crash` |
| `architecture` | Design decisions and patterns | `/update-context architecture microservices` |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring efforts | `/update-context refactor state-management` |
| `performance` | Performance optimizations | `/update-context performance query-optimization` |
| `security` | Security implementations | `/update-context security rate-limiting` |

## What Gets Captured

Each documentation file includes:
- **Overview**: Clear summary of what this is about
- **Problem/Goal**: What you're solving and why
- **Solution**: Technical approach and implementation details
- **Key Decisions**: Why you chose this approach over alternatives
- **Tradeoffs**: Benefits and costs
- **Related Files**: Which files are involved
- **Testing**: How to verify it works
- **Status**: Current state (In Progress, Complete, etc.)
- **Future Improvements**: Known limitations and next steps

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Documentation
```bash
/update-context feature data-grid-improvements
```
Creates: `.claude/context-docs/features/data-grid-improvements.md`

### Example 2: Bug Documentation
```bash
/update-context bug connection-modal-crash
```
Creates: `.claude/context-docs/bugs/connection-modal-crash.md`

### Example 3: During Conversation
```
You: "I just implemented WebSocket communication for real-time updates"
Claude: "Great! Let me document this architectural decision..."
[Creates .claude/context-docs/architecture/websocket-communication.md]
```

## Tips

1. **Document as you go**: Invoke this skill during or right after discussions
2. **Use descriptive names**: Choose clear, searchable names for your docs
3. **Update when needed**: Re-run with the same name to update existing docs
4. **Commit to git**: Include `.claude/context-docs/` in your repository
5. **Share with team**: These docs become great onboarding material

## File Structure

```
~/.claude/skills/update-context/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill instructions (Claude reads this)
├── template.md           # Full documentation template
├── examples/
│   └── sample-context.md # Example of what documentation looks like
└── README.md             # This file (for you!)
```

## Benefits

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture "why" decisions were made
- **Team Onboarding**: New developers can read decision history
- **Context for AI**: Future Claude sessions can read these docs
- **Living Documentation**: Update docs as implementation evolves
- **Cross-Project**: One skill works across all your projects

## Customization

Want to customize the template? Edit:
```
~/.claude/skills/update-context/template.md
```

Changes will apply to all future documentation generated by this skill.

## Workflow Integration

Perfect for these workflows:

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Start feature → Document plan with `/update-context`
   - During implementation → Update with key decisions
   - After completion → Final update with outcomes

2. **Bug Fixing**:
   - Investigate bug → Document findings
   - Implement fix → Document root cause and solution
   - Test → Document verification steps

3. **Architecture Reviews**:
   - During design discussion → Capture alternatives considered
   - After decision → Document rationale and tradeoffs
   - Post-implementation → Update with lessons learned

## Multi-Tool Compatibility

While built for Claude Code, these markdown files work with:
- **Cursor**: Read docs for context in future sessions
- **VS Code Copilot**: Reference docs in comments
- **GitHub Copilot**: Docs provide codebase context
- **Manual reference**: Human-readable documentation

## Getting Listed on skills.sh

To get this skill listed on [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

1. **Fork this repository** or create your own version
2. **Submit a PR** to the skills.sh registry (check their documentation for the exact process)
3. **Ensure your skill has**:
   - A valid `SKILL.md` file with proper frontmatter
   - Clear documentation in `README.md`
   - An MIT or similar permissive license
   - Example usage in the `examples/` directory

## Troubleshooting

### Skill not appearing?
1. Verify file exists: `ls ~/.claude/skills/update-context/SKILL.md`
2. Restart Claude Code CLI
3. Try manual invocation: `/update-context feature test`

### Context directory not created?
The skill creates `.claude/context-docs/` in your **project root** (not global).
Navigate to your project directory first.

### Want project-specific skill instead?
Copy this skill to your project:
```bash
cp -r ~/.claude/skills/update-context ./.claude/skills/
```
